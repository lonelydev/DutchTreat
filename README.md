# MVC tutorial 

As I was following Shawn Wildermuth's tutorial on Pluralsight to build an ASP.Net Core project using MVC, Entity Framework Core, Bootstrap and Angular, I thought I would keep track of my progress. 
Adding my progress to git was a good way to see how often I went through the course.
